# Google APIs Integration

## TL;DR

Use this skill to compile a safe, offline integration plan across Sheets, Docs,
Calendar, Maps JavaScript, and YouTube Data APIs. The deterministic compiler is
`scripts/compile-google-apis-integration.py`; it reads only local `assets/` and
JSON fixtures, renders Markdown or JSON, and never calls Google, OAuth, HTTP,
network, or MCP tools. [CODE]

## Deterministic Assets

- `assets/google-apis-integration-schema.json` defines the stable input contract. [CODE]
- `assets/service-catalog.json` maps services to official REST or client-side operations. [DOC]
- `assets/auth-scope-policy.json` encodes least-privilege OAuth scopes and API-key profiles. [DOC]
- `assets/error-retry-policy.json` defines retry, quota, backoff, and idempotency gates. [DOC]
- `assets/consent-secrets-policy.json` defines human consent and secret-handling policy. [CODE]
- `assets/test-matrix-policy.json` defines required test layers for multi-API plans. [CODE]
- `assets/source-map.md` records the primary official references used by this skill. [DOC]
- `assets/google-apis-integration-template.md` renders the offline report. [CODE]

## Procedure

### Step 1: Classify Services And Operations

- Select one or more service entries: `sheets`, `docs`, `calendar`, `maps_js`, or `youtube`. [CODE]
- Map every requested action to an operation in `assets/service-catalog.json`. [DOC]
- Separate read-only, browser-render, and mutating operations before selecting credentials. [CODE]

### Step 2: Select Auth And Scopes

- Use OAuth 2.0 profiles for Workspace and YouTube user-data operations. [DOC]
- Use a restricted API key profile for Maps JavaScript browser loading and public YouTube reads when user data is not required. [DOC]
- Choose the narrowest profile in `assets/auth-scope-policy.json`; broad write scopes require an explicit escalation reason. [CODE]
- Keep client secrets, refresh tokens, and OAuth token exchange server-side. [CODE]

### Step 3: Build The Offline Operation Plan

- Include resource identifiers, selected auth profile, requested scopes, retry policy, quota strategy, and idempotency key for each service operation. [CODE]
- For mutating operations, include read-before-write evidence unless the operation is explicitly modeled as browser-render or public read. [CODE]
- For Maps JavaScript, include key restriction and allowed API checks instead of OAuth scopes. [DOC]

### Step 4: Gate Consent, Retries, And Idempotency

- Mutating operations require `human_consent.status=confirmed` and confirmation text beginning with the configured consent phrase. [CODE]
- Mutating operations require a stable `idempotency_key` so retries can be correlated and duplicate effects can be reviewed. [CODE]
- Retry plans must distinguish user-fix errors, auth refresh/re-auth, quota/rate-limit backoff, and transient 5xx retry. [DOC]

### Step 5: Validate And Export

- Run `bash skills/google-apis-integration/scripts/check.sh` after modifying this skill. [CODE]
- Use Markdown output for human review and JSON output for stable downstream automation. [CODE]
- Live API execution remains outside this skill; this skill compiles a plan/checklist only. [CODE]

## Worked Example

Request: "append a row to a tracking sheet and create a Calendar invite." Plan: [INFERENCIA]

- `sheets.spreadsheets.values.append` — OAuth, scope `spreadsheets`, `idempotency_key=sheet-append-<runId>`, retry profile `quota-backoff`, read-back via `values.get` on the appended range. [CODE]
- `calendar.events.insert` — OAuth, scope `calendar.events`, consent required (sends invitations), `idempotency_key=cal-<eventHash>`, `sendUpdates=all` only after consent confirmed. [CODE]
- Compiler emits both operations as mutating, blocks until `human_consent.status=confirmed`, and rejects if either scope is broadened to `spreadsheets`+`calendar` full-access. [CODE]

## Per-Service Defaults

| Service | Default auth | Narrowest common scope/key | Mutating? |
|---|---|---|---|
| sheets | OAuth | `spreadsheets.readonly` → `spreadsheets` | yes on append/update [DOC] |
| docs | OAuth | `documents.readonly` → `documents` | yes on batchUpdate [DOC] |
| calendar | OAuth | `calendar.events.readonly` → `calendar.events` | yes on insert/patch/delete [DOC] |
| maps_js | restricted API key | HTTP-referrer + API allowlist (no scope) | browser-render only [DOC] |
| youtube | OAuth or API key | `youtube.readonly` → `youtube.upload` | yes on upload/insert [DOC] |

## Failure Modes (compiler rejects)

- Mutating op without `idempotency_key` or `human_consent` → blocked before render, not warned. [CODE]
- `maps_js` carrying an OAuth scope, or any service requesting a scope absent from `auth-scope-policy.json` → rejected. [CODE]
- Operation not present in `service-catalog.json` (typo, deprecated, or non-existent surface) → rejected; the skill never invents a surface. [CODE]
- Secret-shaped value (client secret, refresh token, key file path) in fixtures or browser config → rejected by `consent-secrets-policy.json`. [CODE]
- Partial multi-service plan: if one operation fails validation, the whole plan is rejected — no partial render, so callers cannot ship a half-validated plan. [INFERENCIA]

## Quality Criteria

- [ ] Operations map to official Sheets, Docs, Calendar, Maps JavaScript, or YouTube API surfaces. [DOC]
- [ ] Auth profile and requested scopes are least privilege for each operation. [DOC]
- [ ] Maps JavaScript uses restricted API-key policy rather than OAuth scopes. [DOC]
- [ ] Mutations have human consent, read-before-write evidence, retry policy, and idempotency key. [CODE]
- [ ] Secrets policy blocks client-side OAuth secrets, static tokens, and committed credentials. [CODE]
- [ ] Quota/error handling covers 400, 401, 403, 429, 5xx, refresh/re-auth, and backoff behavior. [DOC]
- [ ] Test matrix includes unit, contract, integration-sandbox, e2e-preview, security, quota-error, and consent-gate layers. [CODE]
- [ ] `assets/`, `scripts/`, examples, evals, prompts, templates, and knowledge stay deterministic and offline. [CODE]

## Anti-Patterns

- Requesting full Google account scopes for read-only discovery. [DOC]
- Shipping OAuth client secrets, refresh tokens, or service account keys in browser code or fixtures. [CODE]
- Treating Maps JavaScript browser loading as an OAuth flow. [DOC]
- Retrying mutating operations without an idempotency key or read-back plan. [CODE]
- Sending Calendar invitations, editing Docs/Sheets, or uploading YouTube data without explicit consent. [CODE]
- Calling live Google APIs from local skill scripts or fixtures. [CODE]

## Usage

- `/google-apis-integration` to plan a multi-Google-API integration. [CODE]
- `python3 skills/google-apis-integration/scripts/compile-google-apis-integration.py --input skills/google-apis-integration/scripts/fixtures/google-apis-integration-input.json`. [CODE]
- `python3 skills/google-apis-integration/scripts/compile-google-apis-integration.py --format json --input skills/google-apis-integration/scripts/fixtures/google-apis-integration-input.json`. [CODE]
- `bash skills/google-apis-integration/scripts/check.sh`. [CODE]

## Anti-Scope

- Does NOT execute, authenticate, or call any Google/OAuth/HTTP/MCP endpoint — plan compilation only. [CODE]
- Does NOT manage Google Cloud project setup, API enablement, OAuth consent-screen config, or billing. [DOC]
- Does NOT cover non-listed Google surfaces (Drive, Gmail, Admin SDK, Vertex); add to `service-catalog.json` first or use a dedicated skill. [SUPUESTO]
- Does NOT store, rotate, or vault secrets; it only blocks them from appearing in inputs. [CODE]

## Edge Cases

- Same operation requested twice in one plan: each needs a distinct `idempotency_key`; identical keys are treated as one logical mutation. [INFERENCIA]
- Public YouTube read with no user data: API-key profile is valid and consent is not required. [DOC]
- Batch surfaces (`docs.batchUpdate`, `values.batchUpdate`) count as a single mutating op for consent but should carry per-batch read-back. [DOC]
- Mixed read+write plan: only the mutating subset triggers consent gates; read-only ops still validate scope minimality. [CODE]

## Assumptions & Limits

- The compiler validates local JSON and assets only; it does not verify live OAuth clients, enabled APIs, quotas, ACLs, domain policy, or billing state. [CODE]
- Generated scopes and operations must be reviewed against the target Google Cloud project before deployment. [DOC]
- API references can evolve; rerun a source review against `assets/source-map.md` and official Google docs before changing policies or publishing externally. [DOC]
- Assumed surfaces beyond the five listed services are out of scope until catalogued; verify by diffing the request against `service-catalog.json` keys. [SUPUESTO]
